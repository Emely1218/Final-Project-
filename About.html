    <p>Hi my name is Emely Sanchez.I am originally from Fowler, CA. I reside in Parlier CA. I am a mom of two boys 19 years old and a 17 years old.

	   Bachelors in Organizational leadership and a Masters in Global MBA studies emphasizing in Business Administration.
	   My parents immigrated from Mexixo in the 1980's. I am the oldest from my siblings. I have two brothers and a sister. 
	   Fun fact is that my two brothers are red heads. We don't look like siblings.

	<p>Fun fact I have traveled to China and visited five different cities. China was a great adventure and got to know another culture.
	   I love to travel and visit new places. I would love to visit New York, Chicago and Florida. I have other places on my bucket list like Paris and visit the wonders of world. </p>
